<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m an interdisciplinary techie&nbsp;+ marketer on a mission to foster community and find the best breakfast taco in ATX.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>"Love, Sanj" is my creative outlet to grow as a writer and young adult. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for joining me on this adventure.</p></blockquote>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Living in Austin, I am constantly inspired by the people and places around me. It’s that eclectic, yet simple Austin personality which drives my creativity and influences my work. By day, I work in marketing at Facebook. By night, I dabble in baking vegan treats, exploring Indian fashion trends, and planning my next big exotic escapade. </p>
