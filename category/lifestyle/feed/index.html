										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The self-isolation is finally getting to me. I thought, as a self-proclaimed introvert, I would have absolutely no trouble staying in. In fact, nothing makes me happier than cocooning in a blanket and binge-watching hours of Schitt&#8217;s Creek. (Can I get an &#8220;Ew, David&#8221;?)</p>



<p>I started the week on a high note, baking <a href="https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/fat/ligurian-focaccia"><u>Ligurian focaccias</u></a> as seen in &#8220;Salt Fat Acid Heat&#8221;, digging into my Chimamanda Adichie novel, and picking up new hobbies like painting and gardening. At night, I joined online CodeNames and Psyche games with friends and gushed about new beauty regimens with my mom. You name a hair mask; we&#8217;ve tried it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s day 14 though, and now I wander around aimlessly. I can&#8217;t stop sleeping, almost depressively like trying to get away from the bad WhatsApp forwards and news. It&#8217;s almost spiraling, but I can&#8217;t help but feel like I&#8217;m not the only one, right? Is anyone else feeling lost and uninterested? And if so, what are you doing to keep your spirits high?</p>



<p>I fully acknowledge that I have the luxury of a well-paying job, roof over my head, and much needed time with my family. There&#8217;s no denying that I&#8217;m fortunate. Yet, is this what novelists mean by ennui? Not just not knowing what to do, but not wanting to either?</p>



<p>Either way, I&#8217;m still optimistic. I can&#8217;t wait to give everyone a tight squeeze and hug when we&#8217;re back to the new normal.</p>
