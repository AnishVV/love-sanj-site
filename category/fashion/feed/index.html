<p>Now you might think this is crazy, but trust me! The simplest outfits are the ones worth remembering.</p>



<p>My mom and I are a dynamic duo &#8212; think Bonnie &amp; Clyde, Tom &amp; Jerry, Shantanu &amp; Nikhil. When we get to babbling over chikankari cuts and stamped prints, indigo dyes and kanjeevaram silks, the figurative sparks fly. This time, though, when my mom brought up the idea of using nothing but a sari border and fresh flower petals to make a wedding outfit, there was heavy hesitation from my end.</p>



<p>Me: &#8220;It just doesn&#8217;t seem fit for a family wedding.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mom: &#8220;Watch me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Now get this, we bought the green fabric from <a href="http://www.vandanafabrics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Chandralok</u></a> and had the lehenga&#8221;crushed&#8221; and stitched by a tailor for $40. The backless choli is made from an old sari border, stacked one on top of each other to create a psuedo-embroidered blouse. (Stitched for $13 and seriously&#8230; nothing on that blouse is hand embroidered). Finally, the crème de la crème, the draped floral dupatta or <em>phoolon ka chaddar</em>, was hand woven by a florist in Mumbai for $80. Sure, the dupatta was as expensive as the outfit itself (and could only be worn once), but the end product was stunning.</p>



<p>When I danced through the mehendi, intoxicating whifs of jasmine carried with each skirt flip and swivel. The royal green palette was ideal for a traditional wedding festivity, and the blouse made room for heavy jewelry. I share this outfit as my first blog post, because it&#8217;s unique, traditional, and oh so fun.</p>



<p>I hope it inspires you to create something too.</p>

<p>I recently attended a big fat Indian wedding in Cancun, so naturally I took to the internet to gush about it.</p>



<p>Beach/destinations weddings are something special &#8212; intimate ceremonies, late night dance practices on the beach, cotton candy sunsets, and of course, flowy lehengas worn with chutzpah.</p>



<p>Below is a compilation of some of the outfits I wore at the wedding (for which I was a bridesmaid for the first time!) I tend to gravitate towards pastel colors and light beading, and outfits that keep my suitcase teetering right below the minimum weight. It&#8217;s tough to pack light, but with grit, sweat, and tears, you can do it too.</p>
