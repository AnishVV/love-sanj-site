<p>I recently attended a big fat Indian wedding in Cancun, so naturally I took to the internet to gush about it.</p>

<p>Beach/destinations weddings are something special -- intimate ceremonies, late night dance practices on the beach, cotton candy sunsets, and of course, flowy lehengas worn with chutzpah.</p>

<p>Below is a compilation of some of the outfits I wore at the wedding (for which I was a bridesmaid for the first time!) I tend to gravitate towards pastel colors and light beading, and outfits that keep my suitcase teetering right below the minimum weight. It's tough to pack light, but with grit, sweat, and tears, you can do it too.</p>
