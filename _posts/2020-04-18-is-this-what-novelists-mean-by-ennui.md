<p>The self-isolation is finally getting to me. I thought, as a self-proclaimed introvert, I would have absolutely no trouble staying in. In fact, nothing makes me happier than cocooning in a blanket and binge-watching hours of Schitt's Creek. (Can I get an "Ew, David"?)</p>

<p>I started the week on a high note, baking <a href="https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/fat/ligurian-focaccia"><u>Ligurian focaccias</u></a> as seen in "Salt Fat Acid Heat", digging into my Chimamanda Adichie novel, and picking up new hobbies like painting and gardening. At night, I joined online CodeNames and Psyche games with friends and gushed about new beauty regimens with my mom. You name a hair mask; we've tried it.</p>

<p>It's day 14 though, and now I wander around aimlessly. I can't stop sleeping, almost depressively like trying to get away from the bad WhatsApp forwards and news. It's almost spiraling, but I can't help but feel like I'm not the only one, right? Is anyone else feeling lost and uninterested? And if so, what are you doing to keep your spirits high?</p>

<p>I fully acknowledge that I have the luxury of a well-paying job, roof over my head, and much needed time with my family. There's no denying that I'm fortunate. Yet, is this what novelists mean by ennui? Not just not knowing what to do, but not wanting to either?</p>

<p>Either way, I'm still optimistic. I can't wait to give everyone a tight squeeze and hug when we're back to the new normal.</p>
